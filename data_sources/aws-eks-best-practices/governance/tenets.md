# Tenets

### EKS Specificity

- **Focus on Amazon EKS:** Contributions must be specifically relevant to Amazon EKS, emphasizing features, configurations, and best practices unique to EKS.
- **Avoid General Kubernetes Best Practices:** Unless they provide added value in the context of EKS, general Kubernetes best practices should not be the focus.

### Non-Promotional

- **Objective and Unbiased:** Content should maintain objectivity, focusing on technical merit rather than promotional material.
- **No Advertising:** Avoid content that serves as advertising for specific products or services, even if they are related to EKS.

### Succinct and Relevant

- **To the Point:** Contributions should be concise, avoiding unnecessary detail that does not add value to the topic.
- **Relevance is Key:** Ensure all content is relevant to EKS users, providing actionable insights and best practices.

### Inclusion and Collaboration

- **Promote Inclusion:** Encourage contributions from a diverse range of contributors, fostering an inclusive community.
- **Collaborative Spirit:** Support a culture of collaboration, where contributors work together to improve and refine content.
