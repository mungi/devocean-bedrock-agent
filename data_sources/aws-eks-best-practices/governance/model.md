# Project Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the EKS Best Practices Guide project. Our governance model is designed to ensure efficient project management, high-quality contributions, and an inclusive environment for contributors and maintainers.

## Governance Structure

### Steering Committee

- **Role:** Provides overall strategic direction, resolves conflicts, and makes high-level project decisions.
- **Composition:** Key individuals with a deep understanding of the project's domains.
- **Responsibilities:** Approving new maintainers, overseeing project progress, and ensuring alignment with project goals.

### Working Groups

- **Role:** Focuses on specific project areas, reviewing and approving changes.
- **Categories:** Infrastructure, Security, Autoscaling, Resiliency, Windows, Networking, Cost Optimization.
- **Composition:** Each group has a chair and maintainers, with a 6-month rotation to ensure fresh perspectives.
- **Responsibilities:** Managing contributions in their respective areas, ensuring documentation quality, and facilitating the review process.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Steering Committee Members

- Oversee project direction and make decisions on high-impact changes.
- Approve nominations for new maintainers and steering committee members.
- Resolve conflicts and ensure the project's goals are consistently met.

### Working Group Chairs
- Responsible for ensuring that pull requests (PRs) within their domain are reviewed and merged in a timely manner.
- Identifying and nominating suitable candidates to serve as maintainers for their respective working groups.

### Working Group Maintainers

- Review and approve contributions within their area of expertise.
- Responsible for ensuring timely reviews, either by themselves or by delegating to an appropriate reviewer.
- Participate in the 6-month rotation, bringing in new ideas and perspectives.

## Contribution Process

Contributions are encouraged and should follow the guidelines laid out in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. This includes using the correct pull request (PR) templates, adhering to coding and documentation standards, and undergoing a review process by the appropriate working group's maintainers.

## Rotation Policy

Maintainers are subject to a 6-month rotation to foster diversity of thought and to distribute workload evenly. Details on the rotation schedule and process are managed by the steering committee.

## Nomination and Approval Process

All nominations start with a PR to the [steering.md](steering.md) file.
- **Steering Committee:** New members can be nominated by current members, requiring approval by at least two existing members.
- **Maintainers:** Nominated by any project contributor or self-nominated, requiring approval by working group chair.

## GitHub Mechanisms

- **CODEOWNERS File:** Automates the assignment of reviewers to pull requests.
- **Teams:** Organizes maintainers and steering committee members.
